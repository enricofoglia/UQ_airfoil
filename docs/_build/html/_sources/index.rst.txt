UQ_airfoil documentation
========================

**UQ_airfoil** is a python package that allows to build various kinds of Deep Learning models build on graphs to learn the pressure distribution and the aerodynamic efficiency of a dataset of 2D airfoils. Since no model is perfect, we provide various uncertainty quantification (UQ) methodologies to estimate the level of epistemic uncertainty of the neural network.
